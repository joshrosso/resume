      I left VMware to try my hand at co-founding Arctir, where I'm focusing on
      defining engineering practices and building the platform. We are an early
      (pre-revenue) company building a platform that improves visibility into
      an organization's software landscape. Our stack includes Go, Typescript,
      React, AWS, and Postgres.
    jobs:

  - company: VMware

    logoUrl: 'https://files.joshrosso.com/img/site/resume/vmware.png'
    description: |
      I joined VMware as part of the Heptio acquisition. At VMware, I built the
      technology and team that was VMware Tanzu CE, VMware's open-source
      Kubernetes distribution. This grew into one of VMware's largest
      open-source projects, deployed in a variety of scenarios from production
      platforms to local development environments. As the tech lead, my work
      included creating design proposals, implementing (coding) features,
      growing the technical aptitude of the team, and interfacing with product
      management to help shape the roadmap.
    accomplishments:
      - item: Achieved executive-level acceptance and funding of program.
      - item: Grew the team to 7 full-time engineers.
      - item: Implemented the unmanaged cluster model, which was widely loved by our users.
      - item: Became one of VMware's largest open-source projects.
    jobs:
      - role: Tech Lead (Sr. Staff Software Engineer)

  - company: Heptio
    logoUrl: 'https://files.joshrosso.com/img/site/resume/heptio.png'
    description: |
      I joined Heptio, founded by 2 of the creators of Kubernetes, as an early
      engineer focusing on field engineering. In Field engineering we are
      embedded engineers within strategic accounts and help them architecture,
      deploy, scale, and extend their Kubernetes deployments. During my time in
      this role, I architected and deployed Kubernetes at some of the largest
      banks and telcos in the US. Along with architecture work, development was
      often required to make Kubernetes fit within requirements. This often
      required writing controllers (typically in Go, sometimes Python), which
      could extend functionality in Kubernetes. Multiple implementations done
      at customers were brought back and built into product, such as our
      namespace provisioner, which enabled self-service environments to teams in an
      organization. In my work at Heptio, enablement was a huge focus and I
      have helped many SRE teams get the skill sets needed to support their
      newly built platform over time. Much of the insight gained from my
      experience at Heptio was translated into my book Production Kubernetes
      (O'Reilly). We (Heptio) eventually exited via an acquisition by VMware.
    accomplishments:
      - item: Architected and deployed Kubernetes at Heptio's largest account.
      - item: Built a multitude of platform extensions, some of which became product.
      - item: Contributed to and built atop Cluster API and kubeadm.
    jobs:
      - role: Staff Field Engineer
        start: 2018-09
        end: 2018-11
      - role: Senior Field Engineer
        start: 2018-03
        end: 2018-09
  - company: CoreOS
    logoUrl: 'https://files.joshrosso.com/img/site/resume/coreos.png'
    description: |
      I joined CoreOS as I was excited about their many projects at the
      forefront of containers and Kubernetes. Including but not limited to
      etcd, rkt, and fleet. I was an early engineer brought in to split my time
      between product development and acting as a resident engineer with our
      customers. While I was involved in a variety of customer deployments, our
      most notable was with Ticketmaster where we were one of the earliest
      shops to use Kubernetes in production. Getting to production involved a
      lot of engineering and platform extensions to make it meet requirements,
      namely around ingress and network-layer packet routing. This project was
      a highly-celebrated success along with being one of CoreOS's largest
      revenue streams. With my time at CoreOS I also authored the AWS Ingress
      controller, which is used in Amazon EKS today, and built multiple features for
      Tectonic, CoreOS's Kubernetes platform, which much of the technology was
      used to power OpenShift. We (CoreOS) eventually exited via an acquisition
      by RedHat.
    accomplishments:
      - item: Engineered a Kubernetes-based platform at Ticketmaster, CoreOS's largest client.
      - item: Built substantial tooling that became part of Tectonic, operators, etcd, and more.
      - item: Co-created and maintained the alb-ingress-controller, which is now adopted by EKS.
    jobs:
      - role: Senior Software Engineer
        start: 2016-10

  - company: MuleSoft
    logoUrl: 'https://files.joshrosso.com/img/site/resume/mulesoft.png'
    description: |
      I joined MuleSoft with an intent to transition from technical training to
      full-time software engineering, which I did. This was my first exposure
      to software at massive scale. My feature work was writing the Java-based
      API gateway product that was critical path for all API requests used in
      one of the world's largest food chains. It featured a world-wide cut over
      and request-per second load that is still one of the highest of my
      career. Along with software engineering, I facilitated multiple training
      courses across the globe that enabled Java developers to build
      integrations with the Mule framework. We (MuleSoft) IPO'd and upon
      becoming public I transitioned out to CoreOS.
    accomplishments:
      - item: Built an API gateway that became part of key product and ran at our largest customer.
      - item: Engineered a variety of internal data integrations crucial to the training and marketing business.
      - item: Built OAuth2 flows that powered our gateway product and ensured configurable auth.
      - item: 'Built multiple (Java) adapters that acted as interfaces to external systems.'

      - role: Senior Software Engineer

    description: |
      Joining Hyland Software was my first foray into software development
      outside of personal projects. I built curriculum and taught software
      standards for technical internal employees, often onboarding software
      engineers, such that they could be brought up to speed with the technical
      stack of Hyland. During this time I fell in love with software
      engineering and knew I wanted to find a company open to providing me the
      opportunity to move out of training into engineering. This motivation
      brought me to MuleSoft.
    accomplishments:
      - item: Created a frontend model for our CRM system that was used to sell OnBase Workview.
      - item: Delivered the majority of developer and technical trainings to on boarding employees.
      - item: Built automation that was capable of quickly provisioning training infrastructure idempotently.
