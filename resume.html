          <h3>VMware: Tech Lead (Sr. Staff Software Engineer)</h3>
          <p>I joined VMware as part of the Heptio acquisition. At VMware, I built the
technology and team that was VMware Tanzu CE, VMware's open-source
Kubernetes distribution. This grew into one of VMware's largest
open-source projects, deployed in a variety of scenarios from production
platforms to local development environments. As the tech lead, my work
included creating design proposals, implementing (coding) features,
growing the technical aptitude of the team, and interfacing with product
management to help shape the roadmap.

          <h3>Heptio: Staff Field Engineer</h3>
          <p>I joined Heptio, founded by 2 of the creators of Kubernetes, as an early
engineer focusing on field engineering. In Field engineering we are
embedded engineers within strategic accounts and help them architecture,
deploy, scale, and extend their Kubernetes deployments. During my time in
this role, I architected and deployed Kubernetes at some of the largest
banks and telcos in the US. Along with architecture work, development was
often required to make Kubernetes fit within requirements. This often
required writing controllers (typically in Go, sometimes Python), which
could extend functionality in Kubernetes. Multiple implementations done
at customers were brought back and built into product, such as our
namespace provisioner, which enabled self-service environments to teams in an
organization. In my work at Heptio, enablement was a huge focus and I
have helped many SRE teams get the skill sets needed to support their
newly built platform over time. Much of the insight gained from my
experience at Heptio was translated into my book Production Kubernetes
(O'Reilly). We (Heptio) eventually exited via an acquisition by VMware.

          <h3>CoreOS: Senior Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>I joined CoreOS as I was excited about their many projects at the
forefront of containers and Kubernetes. Including but not limited to
etcd, rkt, and fleet. I was an early engineer brought in to split my time
between product development and acting as a resident engineer with our
customers. While I was involved in a variety of customer deployments, our
most notable was with Ticketmaster where we were one of the earliest
shops to use Kubernetes in production. Getting to production involved a
lot of engineering and platform extensions to make it meet requirements,
namely around ingress and network-layer packet routing. This project was
a highly-celebrated success along with being one of CoreOS's largest
revenue streams. With my time at CoreOS I also authored the AWS Ingress
controller, which is used in Amazon EKS today, and built multiple features for
Tectonic, CoreOS's Kubernetes platform, which much of the technology was
used to power OpenShift. We (CoreOS) eventually exited via an acquisition
by RedHat.

          <h3>MuleSoft: Senior Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>I joined MuleSoft with an intent to transition from technical training to
full-time software engineering, which I did. This was my first exposure
to software at massive scale. My feature work was writing the Java-based
API gateway product that was critical path for all API requests used in
one of the world's largest food chains. It featured a world-wide cut over
and request-per second load that is still one of the highest of my
career. Along with software engineering, I facilitated multiple training
courses across the globe that enabled Java developers to build
integrations with the Mule framework. We (MuleSoft) IPO'd and upon
becoming public I transitioned out to CoreOS.

          <h3>Hyland Software: Technical Trainer</h3>
          <p>Joining Hyland Software was my first foray into software development
outside of personal projects. I built curriculum and taught software
standards for technical internal employees, often onboarding software
engineers, such that they could be brought up to speed with the technical
stack of Hyland. During this time I fell in love with software
engineering and knew I wanted to find a company open to providing me the
opportunity to move out of training into engineering. This motivation
brought me to MuleSoft.
